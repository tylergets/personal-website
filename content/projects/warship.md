# Warship

The goal of warship is to reduce friction when starting an application. It can be costly to run a service on AWS or GCP if it has almost no traffic.

Warship can run on a local server and keep everything in house.

## Goals

 * Deploy an application from Github
 * Start that application in a container
 * Assign subdomain to that container
