# Co Founders Wanted

Hey! My name is Tyler and I am a full-stack developer; Anyone have any advice about finding a business minded co-founder? Usually opposite of what people are looking for. I've built tons of apps and have a good track record of shipping; I have ideas but I'd like to build and market at the same time (or have someone with a market insight/experience that can sell direct). My main niche has been anything that can cashflow around ~100 days
